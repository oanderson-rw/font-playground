Simply a showcase (or "playground," as it was originally known) of several sans-serif fonts in various sizes and scenarios.

## To add a font
1. Put the font in the `assets/fonts` directory
2. Update the `assets/fonts/fonts.js` object to include the new font

Done!

## Serving locally
Use your favorite local server and point it at this source directory.

My usual method in a shell is changing the current working directory to the top level of the font-playground source directory and run `npx live-server .`.
